**Meeting Planning**

Team's preferred communication method (email, text, bcourse messaging, etc.):
Meetings (When? How frequently will you meet? Are there times or days that work well for everyone?):
Future non-academic commitments that might affect members' availability:
Meeting tempo (“checking in” at the beginning of meetings versus “just sticking to business”):


EXTRA POINTS LISTED ON ASSIGNMENT TO ADDRESS (SOME REPETITIVE):

_**Roles and responsibilities**_

Team's preferred communication method:
Team's preferred meeting times and frequency:
Team's preferred method for tracking progress:
Point person for contacting course facilitators with questions:
Point person for submitting all milestones:

**Roles**

How is your team going to keep track of progress? Who will be taking minutes, creating agendas, and contacting the course facilitators with questions?
We encourage you to discuss potential dates and times to meet with a course facilitator during Weeks 3-5. Decide on the best date and time for all.
Determine a point person to submit each assignment for the team.

**Conflict Management (Not really something to write up here?)**

If a conflict arises, plan to solve the issue as soon as possible. This is best done using synchronous (Zoom, Google Hangouts) communication rather than asynchronous (email).
If the group is unable to resolve the conflict, seek advice from the instructional team.
