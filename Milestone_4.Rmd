\newpage
## Milestone #4 assignments

1) Need to join 2 data sets first via inner_join()

Visualizations (3 total)
**one print quality tables per scenario**
With Kable: pack-years vs. asthma/heart disease/diabetes/mental illness (1 table)

\newline **one print quality plot or chart per scenario**
With ggplot: 1 bar graph (x = disease, y = pack-years)

\newline **one additional table or plot**
With ggplot: 1 bar graph (x = race, y = frequency of purchase location)

# Each visual should include: 
\newline **code**
\newline **legend (if necessary) **
Unless we decide to input a third variable in a graph.

\newline **interpretation (1 to 2 sentences)**

##PDF should be prepared for presentation 
\newline**each part of milestone on new page** 
\newline**only necessary info outputted** 
\newline **show work with "echo"**
